Welcome back to The Purple Dog Enterprises Coding Channel’s Essentials of Programming series. In this post I’ll introduce you to variables and describe how variables are used as changing values, using input as variables, and reusing variables.

Variables are stored values that can be used in a computer program. A good way to think of a variable is as a container for information.

A variable can change based on information the program receives. For instance, the number of lives a player has in a video game is a variable and will change when certain conditions happen within the game.

Using a variable as a changing value is very common in programming. Let’s say that we wanted to keep track of the number of cats someone has. If they started without any cats then the number of cats variable would be zero. If we added one then the number of cats variable would go up to one, and so on and so forth. Pretty straightforward stuff.

When programming you will also see input being used as variables. In this example there are variables assigned to both first name and last name. A new variable, full name, is created by using the input from the other variables.

Variables can be reused throughout a program. This allows you to save time because if you change the value of a variable you only have to do it once and you don’t have to change it manually for every instance where the variable appears.

The main point to remember is that variables are stored values that can be used in a computer program and a good way to think of a variable is as a container for information.

In the next part of the series I’ll cover different specific types of variables.
