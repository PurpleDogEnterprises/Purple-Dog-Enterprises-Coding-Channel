I would like to welcome you to the Purple Dog Enterprises Coding Channel. This blog on Medium.com will work in partnership with the YouTube channel I created to help my friends and anyone else out there who wants to learn about programming, coding, computer science, technology, and web development.

I believe that the ability to read and write code will be the new standard of literacy as we progress in 21st century and I don’t want to see anyone left behind who doesn’t want to be.

The Purple Dog Coding Channel will have something for everyone whether you’re a complete beginner, you have intermediate skills, or you’re a seasoned professional.

In addition to bite-sized instructional guides I will also feature longer tutorial series, tips and tricks of the trade, personal opinions, advice, interviews with other professionals in the field, and science and technology book reviews.

Remember to follow and subscribe. I wish you good luck on your coding journey and I look forward to helping you learn more along the way.
